            <br>Everyone enjoys the taste of craft coffee, but no one enjoys shelling out $6 each time they want a fancy cold brew or a perfectly frothed latte. Even if buying coffee is a weekly treat (at most), those expenses add up â€” at the end of the month, you're looking at nearly $25 worth of coffee that you could have made at home for way less. <br><br>

            And, according to Pinterest, people seem to be catching onto that idea. Searches are up 3,595% year-over-year for "iced coffee recipes at home" and searches for "at home coffee bar" are up 647% from last year. So, if you're looking to ditch the drive-thru and elevate your at-home coffee experience, you're in luck.
